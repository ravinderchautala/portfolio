<p>
  Hello, I am Ravinder Chautala and I am a web developer. I live and work in
  somewhere warm. I spend most of my day, experimenting with HTML, CSS and
  JavaScript (and its endless list of frameworks). I enjoy coding and the
  challenge of learning something new everyday. You can also find me at linkedin
